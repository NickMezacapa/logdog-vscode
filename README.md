# LogDog VSCode Extension

## What is it? ðŸ”Ž

LogDog is a prototyping and debugging extension for Visual Studio Code. The extension runs Vanilla JavaScript with instant feedback. Runtime values are cached and displayed in your editor, inline with your code, each time you save. LogDog makes testing JavaScript blazingly fast. This extension is essentially a free, open-source, and less complex version of [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) or [Console Ninja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.console-ninja). For additional functionality and a better user-experience, I still recommend using [Quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode), but for those looking for an easy-to-use alternative, look no further!
